This ia a python script to book your gym/Lf3 sessions well in advance. I created this as I struggle to book my classes and dont get slots. Can be easily customized with basic python knowledge. 
Run this script in task scheduler

Future Enhancements:
Come out of if statment if class is booked or not found. Send message over slack/mattermost or any tools
